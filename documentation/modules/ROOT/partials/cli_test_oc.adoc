At this point, we should have the oc tool available for use. Let's test this
out by printing the version of the `oc` command:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
oc version
----

You should see the following (or something similar):

[.console-output]
[source,bash]
----
Client Version: 4.7.0
----

If you get an error message, you may not have not updated your path correctly. If after checking your `PATH` you
still cannot get the `oc` command to work, contact your lab instructor for assistence.
